# EphysPy

### Package to extract electrophysiological features from current clamp experiments.

This package provides an API to extract a multitude of features from voltage clamp recordings with the help of the [AllenSDK](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/allensdk.ephys.html). 

### Installation
The package can be installed via `pip install ephyspy`.
Alternatively, clone the package with `https://github.com/berenslab/ephyspy.git` and install using pip via `pip install -e ./ephyspy`.

### Getting started
To get started see [`example.ipynb`](https://github.com/berenslab/ephyspy/blob/main/example.ipynb).

### Documentation
All documentation can be found [here](https://ephyspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

### Acknowledgments
This package builds on previous work by @ybernaerts which was part of the [Phenotypic variation of transcriptomic cell types in mouse motor cortex atlas](https://github.com/berenslab/mini-atlas), which itself was built around the [AllenSDK](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/allensdk.ephys.html).
